"be grateful," you said to me
i am grateful
you tell me that i am lucky
lucky enough to have a roof over my head
and lucky enough to have a full stomach
i am grateful,
i am

i know other people don't have that roof
and people that don't have food,
and i am grateful that i do
i am

but please listen when i say that i am not lucky enough to know what to do with what i've been given
my pain is mine and mine alone to turn over in my hands and to cut myself with
so when you tell me that i am weak
that i am too sensitive and simply destined to fail in this world
it only makes that pain cut a little deeper

you asked me to explain my pain
why is it that i am so broken when i have all this and more
you ask and you scream and you yell, demanding an answer for my selfishness
the words split my lips when i tell you that i am tired
that i don't remember how to do anything except cry and force myself to breathe
that i cannot explain in what way and how i am hurting
but that i simply am

it's been years but i still remember
the betrayal and hurt when your response to my pain was only to inflict more
the helplessness i felt when i realized i had to do this alone
i was not supposed to be alone

you were my lighthouse
my last resort for shelter when i was drowning
but you forced me to burn that bridge when i saw that look in your eyes that screamed, "you are not mine"
and now you have the nerve to stand there and ask me why i won't let you into my heart -- why i have shut you out where it matters
you have the nerve to look surprised when i tell you that i have wanted to die, ignoring how i am still here and fighting without you
you stand there and look hurt and spin some self-centered tale of being guilt ridden when you didn't listen when i screamed for help

the accusation in your eyes says more than enough -- you may want to care now but not enough to swallow your pride
it was not my fault and it was never my fault.

i am still unlearning all the poison you spilled in my ears
i am still regaining the youth and innocence you stole from me
and i have learned that when you say you know best and will always have my best intentions at heart,
you do not mean it enough to let yourself understand that i will never be who you wanted
i will always be too sensitive, too selfish, and a failure in your eyes
but i am not weak

i am sensitive and i am merely shattered pieces, shakily put together
but i am strong because i had to put those pieces together myself,
i am strong because i sliced my fingers open in the process and used my blood to sign away our relationship
and i know you won't say it so i will:
i'm sorry you weren't there for me

i have forgiven, but not forgotten
signed,
your daughter
