    <h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
    <h3><a class="highlight">--------------------------------------------------------</a></h3>
    <p>Coming from an immigrant family, it was not normal for us to speak about mental health. Tough love was praised, and
    while I understand my parents did their best, I am still learning what a healthy family dynamic looks like. When I approached my family for help, 
    I was met with disbelief and shame. Unfortunately, this is a far too common experience, and we should not be taught to ignore our pain.</p>
    <p>
    I built this
    project around the concept of how we often seek out the portrayal of love we experienced in our early years, and as
    such, parents should be careful with how they display “love”. It is far too easy to rationalize abuse as a twisted form of love.</p>
